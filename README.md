My Professional Statement (draft)

2 strengths: attention to detail and project management

I have a keen eye for detail, which I bring from my previous career as a QA Engineer. 
When working on the projects I am able to dig into a feature to uncover functionality issues, which I hope will some day translate into identifying 
vulnerabilities and potential security risks in systems and networks. Having been a tester for a number of years I've developed skills in managing and executing projects with tight deadlines 
and budget constraints, which I am bringing to the field of cybersecurity in order to meet security objectives.

I believe that privacy and integrity are essential values when it comes to personal data. As a cybersecurity professional, I am committed to protecting people's 
personal information and ensuring tht it is used in a responsible and ethical manner. I am also aware of the growing threat of cybercrime and data misuse and the importance of staying up-to-date
on the latest security threats and trends. In my role, I would use my skills and knowledge to help organizations protect their data and systems from attack and to ensure that their customer's 
personal information is safe and secure.

The most interesting thing about the field of cybersecurity for me is that it is constantly evolving with technologies and methods used by perpetrators to harm individuals and organizations. Cybersecurity professionals must constantly adapt their defenses to keep pace. As a cybersecurity professional, I have to constantly challenge myself and expand on the wide range of skills and knowledge I will have to acquire throughout my professional life. It is a requirement to be successful in this profession. This is the field where I can apply my skills in critical thinking, combined with my knowledge of computer networks, operating systems and cybersecurity tools.
